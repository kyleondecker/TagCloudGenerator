# TagCloudGenerator
The objective of this program is to generate a tag cloud from a given input text. 

The program shall ask the user for the name of an input file, for the name of an output file, and for the number of words to be included in the generated tag cloud (a positive integer, say N). 
It gets the file names and number of words and sorts the words out alphabetically and the font weight is changed with respect to the amount of times the word is found compared to the rest in the input file. This is just a basic read and write program to showcase basic java skills. Not intended to be a progress tracker or full showcase of skills.
